FULL CREDIT

NOTE: These are measurements which may vary plus your opinions which may vary a LOT. We won't grade for "correctness", just completeness.

QUESTION 1: What command line argument(s) did you use to achieve a 45 to 60 second runtime? Note: We're only interested in the "real" seconds for this question if you are using the bash time command.

java turing/BreakEnigmaFile 76



QUESTION 2: Provide the full output (including the time command) for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. **Ensure that the result is the same for all 16 runs.** With bash, you can run all of these with a single command if you like, replacing "76" with whatever command line arguments you identified in QUESTION 1: 

for i in {1..16} ; do echo ; echo $i Threads; time java turing/BreakEnigmaFile 76 $i ; done

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

No, the benefit seemed to level off at around 7 threads.

Yes, but the times varied quite a bit based on nothing obvious. It's possible the actual decryption time variance happened to align with which specific encrypted strings fell to a given thread. This seems to be supported by a second run, which roughly follow the same variance set.

Threads   First Run   Second Run
    1     0m47.059s   0m45.838s
    2     0m26.930s   0m25.145s
    3     0m18.000s   0m18.963s
    4     0m21.401s   0m21.395s
    5     0m21.738s   0m22.052s
    6     0m12.007s   0m12.918s
    7     0m15.633s   0m15.123s
    8     0m13.447s   0m12.313s
    9     0m11.934s   0m11.960s
   10     0m13.027s   0m12.660s
   11     0m11.990s   0m11.380s
   12     0m12.144s   0m12.395s
   13     0m14.278s   0m14.253s
   14     0m12.671s   0m12.980s
   15     0m13.574s   0m13.877s
   16     0m13.313s   0m12.937s

QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?


Yes, although it varied significantly as well. It seemed to jump a bit at 8 threads.






BONUS
=====

QUESTION 5: Time your Bonus version of as you did for the Full Credit version. Is this additional layer of threading faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? Why?

It's noticeably faster with between 2 and 8 threads.

QUESTION 6: Which did you find easier to code overall, the hard-coded allocation or the thread pool? Why?

I find thread pools easier to code as well, because allocation of tasks to threads happens naturally with automatic load-balancing.
